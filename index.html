                <p>
                    Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could 
                    improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start 
                    designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and 
                    stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, 
                    something that makes more sense with what I thought. 
                    I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) 
                    made a daily user interface, I really liked the 
                    idea, but the problem was that the result 
                    was just something nice and did not 
                    solve any problem.

                    As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished 
                    or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
